# First we need to simplify the code
f = float

# Secound we define the numbers. In this case it's a not even number.

number = f(input("What number? "))

# Now, we divide that number by 2. It is the a variable

a = number / 2

# Now we make an b variable, it's a as an intiger (INT)

b = int(a)


# Now we compare them!
# There is an if and else, if the if (Pun Intended) statment is correct the number is even and if the statment is false the number is not even.

if a == b:
    print(int(number), "is even")
else:
    print(int(number), "isn't even")
