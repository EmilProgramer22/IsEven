# A really simple "Is Even" app.
It works like this: type in a number and it shows if an number is even!
I even have the code here: 
```
# First we define the numbers. In this case it's a not even number.

number = 23

# Now, we divide that number by 2. It is the a variable

a = 23/2

# Now we make an b variable, it's a as an intiger (INT)

b = int(a)

# Now we compare them!
# There is an if and else, if the if (Pun Intended) statment is correct the number is even and if the statment is false the number is not even.

if a == b:
    print(number, "is even")
else:
    print(number, "isn't even")
```
